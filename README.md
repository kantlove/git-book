## What the hell is this ???
A documentation site generator. Input is a YAML file containing your doc.

## ...but why ?
On a rainy day, I noted some information about my commonly used git commands on a paper. But I keep editing and make it dirty as my backyard.

So I decided to make a web such that the layout is similar to the notes on the paper. And most importantly, the input has to be as simple as possible so that I can feel like I'm writing on a paper (well, not as good but close).

## Getting started
You will need:
- NodeJs

Follow this expert-level walkthrough:

```bash
# clone
git clone ...
# install dependencies
npm install
# run
npm start
```
